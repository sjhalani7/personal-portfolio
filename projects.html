                                <li>Developed Python program using pandas library to automate the data analysis process for career fairs, providing quick & accurate insights into student & employer trends based on demographics & feedback </li>
                                <li>Reduced manual work & saved a weekâ€™s worth of time, increasing efficiency by 700% over 900+ rows of data </li>
                            </ul>
                        <div class="more-info">
                            <p>As a peer career advisor at SCU's career center, I observed the data analysis for career fairs being conducted manually in Excel. Recognizing an opportunity to streamline this process, I proposed to develop a Python program to handle the task. I utilized the pandas library to develop a solution that automated the data analysis which focused on student and employer trends based on demographics and feedback.</p>
                            <p>I am happy to say that the program I developed transformed the data analysis process in the center. My code saved about a week's worth of time and reduced the possibility of manual error, something an Excel-driven process is prone to. </p>
                            <p>This experience was immensely educational, as it allowed me to deepen my coding skills and understanding of data analysis, while also teaching me valuable lessons in problem-solving and process optimization.</p>
