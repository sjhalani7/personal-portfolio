                            <p> I spent the summer at INRIX working on SafetyView, one of INRIX's IQ SaaS applications, developing meaningful, impactful projects, and couldn't be happier with how the summer went. </p>
                            <p>I mainly worked on implementing a multithreaded, automated data update pipeline for an internal tool via APIs and utilizing technologies like AWS Lambda and AWS Step Functions. The project not only added value to the team, by speeding up and improving quality, but also enabled me to gain a massive understanding of serverless computing, large-scale API development, and most importantly, software engineering in the industry. </p>
                            <p>The highlight of my internship was INRIX's Innovation Week: everyone takes a week off their regular tasks and participates in a company wide hackathon to brainstorm new ideas and bring fresh perspectives to the company. I was fortunate to have been a part of this incredible experience, and went so far as to create my own team, leading 12 full-time employees from all around the world to the final round of the hackathon. </p>

                        <p>During my summer at Ernst and Young, I led a project from start to finish for the first time. I was granted the freedom to design and execute the project, blending my knowledge of pandas and matplotlib with new technologies like spaCy and sent2vec for natural language processing.</p>
                        <p>A significant part of this experience was the combination of planning and hands-on implementation, which gave me a peek into the field of project management. I particularly enjoyed researching and developing a method to convert natural language into SQL queries and visualizing the results. This internship was a practical learning journey that enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills.</p>

As a junior in high school, with programming being a relatively new concept, this internship was a tipping point for my journey with computer science, solidifying the passion that was ignited by a Java course a couple years prior.</p>
                        <p>It was the first time I dealt with libraries like pandas, numpy, and sklearn, which really set the path for some future projects and involvements with research (including playing a massive part in choosing data science as my emphasis for my major at Santa Clara!) </p>
