                            <p>Getting involved with research was on my bucket list for my first year, but I never thought I’d be able to get involved with it as much as I did! During a meeting for all computer science majors, I was fortunate to have an amazing conversation with Dr. Smita Ghosh, a professor of computer science specializing in data science. </p>
                            <p>As we talked about her research on detecting fake news online, I reflected on some horrendously racist comments faced by a group of English soccer players following England’s loss to Italy in the European championship of 2022, and proposed an idea to start a research project on detecting hate speech on as social media platforms. </p>
                            <p>The project has evolved a lot since we started, and we recently submitted a paper outlining our findings to the 4th International Conference on Data Science and Machine Learning, which got accepted for publication! Check out the conference and a snippet of the to-be published article below! </p>

                        <p>A project already in full flow when I got involved, TailorEd caught my eye because of how interesting the idea was: analyzing class images and student performances to see which methods of teaching are most effective.</p>
                        <p>Under the mentorship of my lab professor, I took charge of the database management for TailorEd, diving into complex SQL tasks and developing data pipelines. This research assistant role was my entry into the world of data handling!</p>
                        <p>My role eventually evolved over time, with my focus shifting to developing APIs for efficient data transfer, facilitating the dynamic visualization of our educational insights on the front end. </p>
